# Air Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze environmental data (such as temperature, humidity, particulate matter, and gas concentrations) and build models that can forecast air quality levels. This can help raise awareness of pollution trends and support decision-making for healthier living and sustainable environments.
